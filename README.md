## Getting Started

This is a bog standard nextjs app. To get going locally run

```bash
yarn
```

and then

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploying

Deployed via vercel integration.

## Design

Idea here is to use the simple folder base routing nextjs has for both pages and api to keep things simple. We want to leverage routing as much as possible to control what data to display and load. This will also let us leverage the edge computing nextjs has as well.
